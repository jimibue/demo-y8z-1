## Functions

Functions are a key part of any programming language. They are used to perform a specific task. Functions are also known as methods in other programming languages.  Functions are defined using the `function` keyword. Functions can be called using the function name followed by parentheses. Functions can also be called using the `call` keyword. Some of the key parts of functions are:

- **Function Name**: The name of the function. This is used to call the function.
- **Parameters**: The parameters are the values that are passed to the function. The parameters are separated by commas.
- **Return Value**: The return value is the value that is returned by the function. The return value is optional.
- **Function Body**: The function body is the code that is executed when the function is called.
- **Arguments**: The arguments are the values that are passed to the function when it is called.



```ts
// Defining a Function - General syntax
function functionName(param1: type, param2: type): returnType {
  // Function Body: code to be executed
  
  // Return value
  return 'some value'
}

// calling a function
functionName(arg1, arg2)

// setting a variable when calling a function
let returnValueFromFunction = functionName(arg3, arg4)
```
