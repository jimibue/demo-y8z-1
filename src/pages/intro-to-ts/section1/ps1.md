   answer="Comments are used to explain what our code does. They are not executed by the computer."

Q. Why do we write comments in our code?

A. Comments are used to explain what our code does.  Comments are ignored by the compiler, so they do not affect the output of our code.


### Problem 2

Q. Why do we console.log() in our code?

A. We console.log() to print the output of our code to the console.  We can use console.log() to print the value of a variable, or to print the result of a function.

### Problem 3

Q. Describe the basic flow of execution of a program.

A. The flow of execution of a program is the order in which the code is executed.  The flow of execution starts at the top of the file, and executes each line of code in order, until it reaches the end of the file. if a function is called, the flow of execution jumps to the function, and executes each line of code in order, until it reaches the end of the function.  Then the flow of execution jumps back to the line of code that called the function, and continues executing the rest of the code in order.  If a conditional is encountered, the flow of execution jumps to the conditional, and executes the code in the conditional if the condition is true.  If the condition is false, the flow of execution jumps to the end of the conditional, and continues executing the rest of the code in order. If a loop is encountered, the flow of execution jumps to the loop, and executes the code in the loop, and then jumps back to the loop, and executes the code in the loop again, until the condition is false.  Then the flow of execution jumps to the end of the loop, and continues executing the rest of the code in order.

### Problem 4

Q. What are strings?

### Problem 5

Q. What is an operator? What are the different types of operators?





### Problem 

Q. What is the difference between a `for` loop and a `while` loop?

A. A `for` loop is used to iterate over an array, or to repeat a block of code a certain number of times.  A `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code while a condition is true.
