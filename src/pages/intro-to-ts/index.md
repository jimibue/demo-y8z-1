Learning to code is a lot like learning a new language. You need to learn the vocabulary, grammar, and syntax of the language. You also need to learn how to communicate with other people who speak the language. We are going to start by learning the vocabulary and grammar of TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

This will take time, but you will get there! We will start by learning the basic vocabulary of TypeScript, and then we will learn how to use TypeScript to write programs.
